## 📰 _Welcome to Northcoders News front-end!_

<br> 👩🏽‍💻 Hi! I'm Máire, and this repository is part of a portfolio piece created over five days during my time at _[Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/company/about-us)_ full-stack Javascript development boot-camp

👋🏽 Find me here on _[GitHub](https://github.com/maire-digital "let's connect!")_, or on _[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maire-dev/ "let's connect!")_

## <br> Project Background

This repo contains the frontend architecture for a full-stack social news application, "NC News", drawing inspiration from Reddit. The user is able to view a news-feed with all available articles, and to filter articles by topic, comment count, votes, and date. They can also view an individual article page for each article and their associated comments, as well as post and delete their own comments. Each user can choose to toggle between dark and light modes, depending on their preference. It is built using `React.js`, `Axios`, and vanilla `CSS` for all styling.

It uses my [NC News Backend](https://github.com/maire-digital/NC-News-BE) and rounds out this full-stack project.

_You can access a hosted version of this app on [Netlify](https://maire-nc-news.netlify.app/)._
